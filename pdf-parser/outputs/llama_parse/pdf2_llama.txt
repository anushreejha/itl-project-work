F oreword
Teaching and learning of language in school education should be based
on the insight that language learning is a natural process which should
be enhanced in school for academic and overall achievement of the
learners. It is extremely important that learner-centric methodologies
of language learning should be promoted for eliciting critical responses,
and developing sensitivity to social issues.
    The focus of language learning is on developing skills of language and
communicative competence. Language learning progresses naturally
with exposure to and use of language in meaningful situations. In this
context, importance has been attributed in the                   National Curriculum
Framework-2005, to methods of teaching which are process based.
These give opportunities to learners for engaging with texts through
various activities and exercises and equip them for self-assessment.
    In multilingual India, English has been one of the languages which
is being learnt in schools. It is therefore recommended that English
be learnt along with the language of the learners since it leads to
transference of skills from the child’s own language to the second
language (English).
    We, at the NCERT, make an endeavour to provide engaging, relevant,
and authentic resources. This supplements and complements language
acquisition     and    provides     opportunities       for  learners     to   associate
experiences with everyday life.
    The    Council     had   developed      two    books,    First   Flight   (textbook)
and    Footprint    without     Feet   (Supplementary        Reader)     for   Class     X
based    on   the   National Curriculum Framework-2005. The                  workbook,
Words and Expressions 2 is a sequential continuation of these. It has
been developed taking into account the feedback on these books and
needs of learners and teachers.
    The   workbook       has   also   taken    into  account     the   skills  that   are
critical for overall development of the learners, such as the skills of
collaboration, creativity and imagination, critical thinking and problem
solving, communication and compassion.
    We hope this workbook will serve as an effective instrument for
learners and teachers for adding quality to the teaching and learning
processes.     We    are  indebted      to  the   institutions    and    organisations
which have generously permitted us to draw upon their resources and
materials. All the publications of the Council are regularly revised on
the basis of the feedback from students, parents, teachers, and teacher
educators.

rationalisation                         oF     Content                in    the
                               textbooks
In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content
load on students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises
reducing the content load and providing opportunities for experiential
learning with creative mindset. In this background, the NCERT has
undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes.
Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across classes
have been taken into consideration in this exercise.
Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the
following:
•  Content     based    on    genres    of  literature    in   the   textbooks     and
   supplementary readers at different stages of school education
•  Content that is meant for achieving Learning Outcomes for developing
   language proficiency and is accessible at different stages
•  For reducing the curriculum load and examination stress in view of
   the prevailing condition of the Pandemic
•  Content,    which     is  easily   accessible    to   students     without    much
   interventions from teachers and can be learned by children through
   self-learning or peer-learning
•  Content, which is irrelevant in the present context
This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the
changes given above.

about            the       workbook
Words and Expressions 2 is a sequence to the textbook in English for Class
X, First Flight. Like Words and Expressions 1, it is a self-study material.
It lays emphasis on providing a variety of rich and comprehensible
inputs. This gives learners exposure to the target language and enables
them to further their skills in the English language. The passages and
activities given here create opportunities for them to handle the English
language for performing important language functions and help them
develop     critical  thinking     on   contemporary        concerns.     The    book    is
expected to help learners to read for meaning in context and also serve
as a base for communication in the English language.
    There are 11 units in this workbook. The chapters of the textbook and
the units are to be taught in a coordinated manner. The units correspond
to each lesson in the textbook. There are various tasks in each unit.
‘Let’s begin’ is followed by Comprehension passages, Vocabulary tasks,
Grammar exercises, Editing, Listening, Speaking, and Writing activities.
All units end with Project work reiterating the learning through elaborate
activities. The sections have followed an integrated approach and focus
on a particular skill of the English language.
    The introductory section, ‘Let’s begin’ asks questions making the
students think and discuss on the chapter they have read. They are
asked to collect information, read various written texts and e-texts,
watch,    and    listen   to   online   resources      from   Internet     services    like
YouTube. They can also refer to the materials given in the QR code of
the textbook along with the reading aloud of the texts and recitation
of the poems. They are required to work in groups of two or four, note
down points, develop speech, debate, etc., and then to speak before
the whole class. This follows an integrated process of reading with
comprehension, reflection, writing, and expressing thoughts.
    The themes of the unseen comprehension passages, span across
the literary, cultural, and sociological realms — which appeal to and
inspire    the   adolescents — are       chosen     based     on   the   corresponding
chapters in the textbook. Reading Comprehension has prose passages
as well as poems. The familiarity of the context has been taken care
of while selecting the passages. An attempt has been made to expose
the learners to a variety of texts, comprehend the meaning of words
in context, understand the theme, and answer factual and thought-
provoking questions. Learners are also given opportunities to interpret
poems,     be    acquainted      with    beautiful     expressions,      phrases,     and
understand the expressions of the images. Some questions have been
given to infer meaning and other to inspire learners to think critically
and bring out their deeper understanding of the text. Multiple choice
questions are also given in the book for students to assess themselves.

                                       Reprint 2024-25
The workbook is a self-study material for the students. They are
      encouraged to work in pairs or groups so that they support each other
      and learn from each other. However, if required, teachers may guide.
      A variety of tasks, exercises, and ‘Look up and understand’ are placed
      strategically to build vocabulary in the given context. The learners are
      encouraged to use the dictionary as often as required. The intention is
      to help them learn new words and their usages in different contexts.
      Further, ‘Proofreading marks’ have been given for students to learn the
      basics of proofreading and editing.
          The written and spoken compositions are preceded by discussions
      in peer groups. The themes of the composition include contemporary
      issues like gender, environment, diversity, human values, animal rights,
      adolescent issues which are relevant to the age group, and appropriate
      in the contemporary time. This is to enable the learners to see the
      world, develop necessary skills, and face the challenges of the present
      as well as future.
          Enough opportunities are given to the students to develop listening
      comprehension and to use the English language in real-life situations.
      It is reiterated that basic language skills are developed simultaneously,
      not in isolation, but in an integrated manner. So integrated listening
      and speaking activities are given in the book. Grammar activities are
      presented in everyday contexts and are given with keeping usage in
      mind, not the formal explication of grammatical concepts.
          The fine distinction of the workbook is that it is directly addressed
      to the students. The language used is simple, so that there is less
      dependence on the teachers. The activities are simple and stress free,
      enabling the learners to complete these confidently. Self-learning is
      encouraged. The pair or group work will give students an opportunity
      to look at the work of their peers and make each of them feel both
      responsible as well as independent. Every learner has a unique learning
      style. The group work may help them understand their challenges,
      evaluate themselves vis-a-vis their peers, and find the best way to
      overcome them.
          The project activities given at the end of each unit are expected to
      be engaging, across the entire curriculum and interdisciplinary. These
      help generate interest to explore, analyse, think critically, reflect, and
      then present thoughts orally or in writing.
          ‘Fun facts’ are given in the margins throughout the workbook, with
      the hope that the learner would have a lasting impression of the correct
      usage of the English language. Teachers must remember that ‘Fun
      facts’ are for joyful learning and non-evaluative.
          It is hoped that this book will help students use the English language
      effectively    and     meaningfully       for   the   purpose      of   communication
      which will make them proficient and perceptive users of the English
      language. They will find this workbook enjoyable and rewarding as it
      is learner-centered and activity based. Comments and suggestions
      on any aspect of the workbook are welcome. This would enable us to
      improve the next edition.

Perfection is achieved, not when there
is nothing more to add, but when there
is nothing left to take away.

           to edit is divine.
