1. Introduction
The Government e Marketplace
(GeM) platform was launched on 9
th August, 2016 as an online, end
to end solution for procurement
of commonly used goods and
services for all Central Government
and State Government Ministries,
Departments, Public Sector Units
(PSUs) and affiliated bodies. The
purpose of this document is to
establish a robust structure and
basic set of rules that will guide the
different facets of the GeM initiative
across strategy and operations. This
document is in furtherance to the
following Government directives
issued in relation to GeM.
1. Rule 141-A of GFR 2005,
superseded by Rule 149 of GFR 2017.
2. Office Memorandum on GeM
payment and timelines dated 20th
September, 2016.

3. Office Memorandum on the
entry in the Government of India

dated 9th December, 2016.

4. Cabinet Note dated 7th April,
2017.

5. Cabinet Secretariat Notification
dated 8th December, 2017.

This document shall therefore
act as the principle guiding force
basis which GeM shall design its
processes and policies. While this
document shall be revised as the
platform and organization matures,
there are certain key elements of
GeM that are immutable and form
its foundation. The GeM Charter
captures these elements as a set
of commitments that GeM shall
undertake and uphold going
forward.

1.2 GeM Special Purpose
Vehicle
Public procurement amounts to
15-20% of a nation’s GDP2 and
therefore an efficiently run public
procurement process is critical
to our nation’s economy. A well-
functioning and efficient public
procurement system helps the
development process by improving
the strategic and efficient
allocation and utilization of
government expenditure i.e. public
procurement.

For a geographically large and
politically diverse nation such
as India, standardizing public
procurement is a challenging task.
The prevailing public procurement
regime in India is characterized by
fragmented processes and policies
that operate in silos and require
high levels of manual intervention.

The genesis of the Government e
Marketplace (GeM) initiative is thus
driven by the need to deliver a step
change in the public procurement
process in the country and usher
in an era of e-governance by
leveraging the power of digital.

The following entry has been
made in the Government of India
(Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961,
vide notification dated 8 th
December 2017 - “32. Development,
operation and maintenance of
National Public Procurement
Portal—Government e Marketplace”.
The Government e Marketplace
Special Purpose Vehicle (GeM SPV),
a Section 8 (Non-Profit) Private
Limited Company under the
Ministry of Commerce has been
incorporated under the Companies
Act, 2013 to develop, manage and
maintain the GeM platform.
1.3 Founding Principles of the GeM Initiative

›
     1.3.1 Summary of the Cabinet Note
The foundation for the GeM initiative has been laid down through the Cabinet Note on “Setting
up of a Special Purpose Vehicle to be called Government e Marketplace (GeM SPV)” dated 7th
April, 2017. This note defines the purpose with which GeM has been envisioned. This stated
purpose shall play a key role in defining the strategy and operating model for GeM

Key elements from the note are as follows:

Reason behind the GeM initiative

  •  Need for reform to bring consistency in public procurement
  •  Existing malpractices in the system due to buyer-supplier interaction

Founding principles of GeM SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle to develop, manage and maintain the
GeM platform)
  •  Incorporated as a Section 8 Company. Decision on public listing of GeM SPV to be taken
     subsequently.
  •  Autonomous organization which is agile and has flexibility to take market driven decisions
  •  The organization shall break-even and self-sustain its operations from 3rd year onwards.
  •  The sources of monetization (charges to buyers and sellers) shall be kept to minimum,
     enough to sustain running of SPV and pay Managed Service Provider (MSP)
  •  Fully accountable to tax payers and the Government
  •  Promote inclusiveness and ease of doing business with the Government and its agencies

Impact that GeM is expected to deliver

  •  Increase access for procurement - broader outreach, wider variety of goods and services
  •  Increase transparency and efficiency (time & cost) of procurement
  •  Encourage small business units/individuals to do business with the Government
  •  Make procurement data easily available for auditors, administrators, vigilance etc.

It is important to note that as the GeM platform and organization evolve, the founding
principles will also have to evolve. Thus, the principles of GeM and the organization shall be
periodically reviewed and appropriate modifications shall be undertaken in consultation with
key stakeholders and with the consent of the Government.

›    1.3.2 Role and Nature of the GeM Initiative
In the constantly evolving procurement process in the country, it is useful to reiterate the
role of GeM. GeM shall use modern technology and enablers to bring together all government
buyers on a unified online platform for the procurement of commonly used goods and services.
It shall reduce manual process inefficiencies in procurement and provide a paperless and
cashless e-marketplace with a streamlined, consistent process for all users. All buying and
selling stakeholders on GeM shall have to adapt to this standardized process and necessary re-
engineering to this effect will be needed at their end.                                          8
GeM is characterized by three core elements:

Openness                                      Fairness                                  Inclusiveness

2. GeM Platform




2.1 Scope of Operations for the GeM Platform



There are three facets to defining the scope of
operations for the GeM platform:

Who are the customers (both buyers and sellers) that
GeM platform will cater to

What will be the goods and services offered on the
GeM platform

How shall the GeM platform operate to execute the
aforementioned ‘Who’ and ‘What’



Who                                   What


GeM has been                          GeM has been conceived as

accordance with prevalent
laws and regulations,                 While GeM shall seek to cater to
manufacturing or                      all the buyer needs for goods
marketing genuine goods/              and services that are commonly
services to sell on GeM.              used, it shall build its goods and


services offering in a staged
manner. GeM shall prioritize
those goods and services to
be supported in the short

term that have a low level
of customization, are more
standardized and have larger
transaction volumes in the
public procurement domain.
As the GeM platform matures,
it shall support goods
and services requiring higher
degree of complexity.

At the same time, the GeM
platform shall clearly define
the set of goods and services
that the platform shall
never cater to constituting
the exclusion list. This shall
include goods that are highly
specialized and limited to very
niche buyer segment, such
as defence equipment, and

services like mining services.

How

The GeM platform shall be
an open marketplace and
shall focus solely on being
a platform for Government
buyers to meet sellers and
conduct business. It shall
neither own the goods and
services sold through the
platform nor own the supply
and logistics of goods and
services transacted on it. The
GeM platform shall be a trust-
based portal where the buyer
shall hold the responsibility
to ensure value for money
and timely payment in any
purchase made and the seller
shall hold the responsibility
to ensure the accuracy and
integrity of all information
shared, the quality of products
and services sold and the
timeliness of the delivery.
                                      10
2.2 Potential for the GeM Platform3
The value of annual spend on public procurement in India is estimated at anywhere between 18
– 20% of India’s GDP. This spend constitutes the entire universe of goods and services procured.
Approximately 20% of total goods (~2 L Cr) and 7.5% of total services (~1.5 L Cr) can be classified
as goods and services addressable in the short term for the GeM platform. The ability to capture
the largest possible part of this addressable spend and drive it through the platform shall
depend on three key factors:
  •  The proportion of buyers out of the total universe of buyers comprising public procurement
  •  in India that are successfully on-boarded onto the GeM platform
  •  The availability of requisite goods and services, as needed by these buyers, on the platform
     The portion of the buyers’ spend that the platform is able to capture

Given the GeM platform’s starting point, it is envisaged that over a 2 -3 year period, close to
1 L Cr of annual transaction value can be targeted on the platform. Since the procurement
landscape in India is considerably diverse in terms of geographic and policy-related
considerations, higher penetration shall be targeted for buyers covered under Central
Government (such as Central Ministries, Departments, Central Public Sector Enterprises, and
Public Sector Undertakings) which account for ~65% of total addressable spend.

Over a 5 – 6 year period, the GeM platform shall be able to target 2 -3 L Cr. of annual transaction
value and in the long-run (10-12 years) it could potentially capture as much as 5% of India’s
nominal GDP in terms of transaction value. The aspiration is in line with benchmarks of global
best-in-class e-procurement portals (such as ChileCompra, GeBIZ and KONEPS) which capture
anywhere between 4.5% - 6% of their respective countries’ GDP through online transactions
supported by their respective platforms.

2.3 Key Features Supported by the GeM Platform
2.3.1 Registration

The GeM registration process shall be driven by principles of ease, convenience and minimal
data entry. The following key considerations shall be considered in designing the GeM
registration process:

  •  Registration shall be trust based (self-certified) and validated exclusively through online
     integration with domain databases
  •  Aadhaar shall be used as the primary user identification proof
  •  Transfers/personnel movement shall be supported seamlessly by clear distinction of user
     and post

Monitoring and re-verification for detection of inactive user accounts
User accounts shall be regularly monitored to detect inactive accounts. For accounts that the
GeM platform deems inactive basis criteria that GeM may layout and revise from time to time,
users shall be required to re-verify their details in order to ensure that the accounts are active
and updated. The GeM platform shall reserve the right to deactivate accounts that are deemed
unfit or inactive to maintain the sanctity of the platform.

11            3  All figures are as per FY 17 GDP
2.3.2 Catalogue Management (CMS)

        As a marketplace, one of the founding pillars of the GeM platform shall be its goods and
        services catalogue. Given the multitude of buyer organizations that will transact on the
        platform and their large procurement needs, the scale and the spread of the type of
        transactions on the GeM platform shall be enormous. A robust Category Management System
        shall be fundamental to be able to support a standardized buying process, create a competitive
        market and provide the buyer with search and compare capability. The GeM platform shall thus
        provide a rich catalogue with complete information of the features and specifications of the
        offerings.

2.3.2.1 Product and Service Taxonomy: The
United Nations Standard Products and
Services Code


The GeM CMS shall be based on The United
Nations Standard Products and Services
Code® (UNSPSC®)4 , managed by GS1 US
for the UN Development Program (UNDP).
However, efforts to develop harmonized
and customized codification system in
association with other partners such as
GSTN, Railways etc shall be made.

2.3.2.2 Standardization of Technical
Specifications/Parameters


The technical specifications constitute
a critical aspect of public procurement.
One of the key facets of the GeM platform
shall be the standardization of these
specifications/parameters. GeM shall
provide standardized templates of technical
parameters (TP), for both goods and
services, designed to maximize objectivity.

This standardization of parameters shall
be the principal virtue of the GeM platform
that differentiates it from the prevalent
offline processes and systems. This shall
lend itself to GeM being a fair, open and



brand agnostic platform. In addition, while
procuring on the GeM platform, buyers shall
not need to invest the time or effort required
in identifying the right list of parameters that
comprehensively constitute the product or
service.
The TPs on the GeM platform shall be demand
driven, market-aligned, consultative and
dynamic. In a scenario where the buyer
finds the Technical Parameters defined on
the GeM platform for any good or service as
not sufficiently comprehensive and requires
parameters to be either added or modified,
the buyer shall be able to inform GeM of its
requirements. This process shall be inbuilt into
the platform to the extent possible. Standard
Operating Procedures (SOPs) for such upgrades
and updates of TP of GeM catalog will be
dynamic and evolving, without compromising
on the need to keep the GeM catalog generic at
all times.

2.3.2.3 Goods and Services Supported on the
Platform


The GeM platform shall be a dynamic
marketplace where new categories of goods
and services are continuously added. The
platform shall provide buyers and sellers with
the functionality to suggest the goods/services
they need supported. The list of goods and
services excluded from the platform shall also
be clearly published on the platform and may
be subject to change as the platform matures.

          4 GeM reserves the right to add to this classification
          system and customize it as and when needed

                                                                                                        12
2.3.3 Order Placement and Fulfillment

2.3.3.1 Buying Modes Supported

The GeM platform shall provide three primary buying modes and the appropriate use of the
buying mode shall be indicated by the platform as per the total value of the procurement. The
three buying modes are Direct Purchase, Direct Purchase with L1 and e-bid/RA. The GeM platform
shall reserve the right to set the thresholds of transaction value for the applicability of each
of the buying modes based on the GFR and related guidance issued by Ministry of Finance,
Government of India from time to time. All decisions related to use of the modes available
on GeM shall be made solely and exclusively by the buyer with required approvals from the
competent authorities.

Direct Purchase and Direct Purchase with L1

     Direct Purchase mode shall be allowed for low value transactions and shall allow the
     buyer to directly procure from any available seller on GeM that meets the requisite quality,
     specification and delivery period as specified by the buyer.

     The Direct Purchase with L1 mode shall be allowed for mid value transactions and shall allow
     the buyer to directly procure from the L1 seller after comparing all available sellers on the
     platform that meet the requisite quality, specification and delivery period as specified by
     the buyer. The comparison must be made between goods/services of at least three different
     manufacturers/OEMs and three different sellers.

     The GeM platform shall provide buyers with a robust search and filter functionality to enable
     them to specify their exact requirements. It shall also provide the buyer with the functionality
     to exercise purchase preference in these modes by providing filters such as Make in India,
     MSE etc. as per extant Government of India policies and guidelines. The platform shall also
     recommend buyers to purchase from sellers meeting local content/MSE when the prices are
     comparable with the market L1 price.

     These modes shall allow buyers to make time efficient purchases and have strict delivery and
     payment timelines.

E-bid/Reverse Auction

     The E-bid/Reverse Auction mode shall allow buyers to conduct an electronic bid for the
     goods and services on the platform.

     The creation of bid documents as well as system driven evaluation will be driven through
     well-defined and standardized technical parameters and the bid terms and conditions.

     The General Terms and Conditions, Special Terms and Conditions and Additional Terms and
     Conditions provided by the platform shall address the general requirements for floating
     e-bids/RA on GeM.

     The GeM platform shall provide buyers with the option to customize the bid as per their
     requirement by way of objective selections. The buyers can raise requirement for further
     customization of the bid terms and conditions in line with the standardized GeM catalogue
     This is inline with GeM’s objective of maintaining standardization and objectivity throughout
13
the procurement process. All e-bids and RAs on GeM shall be exclusively completed through
     the GeM platform with no reference to any outside source or links.

     The GeM platform shall provide a system driven evaluation of the bids and identify
     the shortlisted i.e. responsive bids. While the buyers are suggested to heed the system
     recommendation, the buyers shall reserve the right to download the evaluation as well as
     override the system evaluation. In case of offline bid evaluation, buyers shall be required
     to provide a summary of the outcome on the platform. In certain situations where Quality
     and Cost Based Selection (QCBS) is absolutely necessary and requires direct interface like
     presentations and in person consultation, such as hiring of consultant/project buying, the
     buyers shall appropriately capture the offline steps on the platform as part of bid evaluation.

Proprietary Article Certificate (PAC) Buying

     The GeM platform shall allow buyers to procure on a proprietary basis by using the PAC filter
     provided on the GeM platform, which allows the selection of a specific model/make from a
     particular seller that is available on the platform.

     For PAC procurement, Direct Purchase buying mode and bidding/RA buying mode (above
     threshold value) shall be allowed.

        to download a report for the purpose of
        audit and shall allow the buyer to show
        verifiable proof for procuring outside the
        GeM platform.

2.3.3.3 Order Fulfillment


The GeM platform shall lay down a
standardized process with definite timelines
for order fulfillment and provide both buyers
and sellers with the functionality to track
the order fulfillment process. The platform
shall enforce buyers and sellers to adhere
to the online process, update the required
information and issue invoices or certificates
as applicable and in a timely manner.

All key documents for order fulfillment and
payment such as the purchase/sanction
order, invoice and bill shall be generated
by the platform based on user input and
selections. GeM shall stipulate the timelines
for the different stages of the process such
as delivery of the goods/services, generation
of Provisional Receipt Certificate (PRC)
and generation of Consignee Receipt and
Acceptance Certificate (CRAC). Users shall
be subject to appropriate rating and action
in case of non-adherence as per GeM policy
notified from time to time on the portal.

2.3.3.4 Contract Management


In keeping with the principles of speed,
efficiency and minimal manual interference,
the GeM platform shall auto-generate
the contract basis the specified technical
parameters and the details chosen by the
buyer such as delivery period and delivery
terms.



15
The General Terms and Conditions (GTC),
Product / Service specific Special Terms
and Conditions (STC) and Bid / RA specific
Additional Terms and Conditions (ATC) shall
be published on the GeM platform. These
shall constitute the contract generated on the
platform. The Terms and Conditions stipulated in
STC will supersede those in GTC, and the Terms
and Conditions stipulated in ATC will supersede
those in GTC and STC in case of any conflicting
provisions. The platform shall provide buyers
with the functionality to edit the auto populated
terms and conditions within the overall GeM
legal framework. GeM shall also provide the
functionality of updating the contract along with
version control and audit trail.

2.3.3.5 Payments


The GeM platform shall support 100%
online payments to ensure a truly cashless
procurement process. This will not only make
the process efficient but also improve timely
payment assurance. The platform shall,
therefore, support multiple online payment
modes in order to maximize convenience and
utility for its users. The platform shall also
support e-EMD and e-PBG to stay true to its
aspiration of 100% online payments.


The GeM platform shall provide users with a
payment gateway to support internet banking
as well as allow integratration with the different
payments systems used by buyers such as Public
Financial Management System, State GeM Pool
Account, Controller General of Defense Accounts,
Centre for Railway Information Systems, Central
Reserve Police Force Payment System etc.
Additionally, the GeM platform shall support the integratation of the different ERP systems (SAP/
Oracle etc.) that are used by the buyers to maximize efficiency and seamlessness. GeM shall lay
down definite timelines for payment and enforce buyers to adhere to stipulated timelines. In
order to promote timely payment, GeM shall constantly endeavor towards and encourage pool
account based payments as the preferred payment mode on GeM.

2.3.3.6 GeM Service levels

As an online system for procurement, GeM service levels shall aim at maximum efficiency in its
operations from placing a demand to closing with payments on time for contracts fulfilled. Each
of the steps across transactions shall have specified time for performance by both sellers and
buyers. All appropriate measures shall be taken to ensure that both buyers and sellers adhere to
these terms and conditions. These measures shall include ratings (parameters), issuing notices,
watch list and defaulters being disabled. All actions under this segment shall be notified to all
users and reflected appropriately for further transactions.

2.3.4 Decision Support

Beyond the cost and time benefits intrinsic to GeM, GeM shall provide its users with additional
value add by providing decision support that helps them achieve better value-for-money and
efficiency.

2.3.4.1 Business Intelligence and Analytics

Analytics helps organizations in harnessing their data, and in using it to make more informed,
evidence-based decisions, which in turn leads to increased operational efficiency and savings.
The GeM platform shall provide its users with personalized dashboards to track overall
transactions and the performance of the buying/selling organization and reports for transaction
summary, payment due, non-adherence of payment/delivery SLAs etc. The platform shall enable
buyers to monitor the trend of their procurement and adherence to the different directives like
Make in India and MSME Policy.

Additionally, the GeM platform shall provide the larger ecosystem of users with intelligence
and analytics on spend trends, registration trends, yearly procurement trends, key goods/
services etc. which shall help in understanding the procurement landscape in India better and
making data led decisions. The analysis of the transactional data on the platform shall enable
the policymakers from MSME and DIPP to recognize key challenges and review and revise
procurement policies accordingly.

2.3.4.2 Information Visibility

The GeM platform shall provide the buyer with the credentials of the seller such as the financial
credentials, past experience and preferential seller credentials such as registered MSE or startup.
The platform shall also ensure visibility for MSE/local sellers and startups. Further, the platform
will enable sellers to indicate the percentage of domestic content in their goods and services,
promoting the Make in India order. The platform shall support real-time sharing of information
relating to all procurement notices through the integration of CPPP.                                 16
2.3.4.3 Establishing Price Reasonability

While the responsibility to ascertain the reasonability of price for any buying on GeM shall
rest solely with the buyer, GeM shall provide the buyer with multiple tools to help the buyer
ascertain price reasonability. This includes the comparison of prices across other e-commerce
sites (wherever available), discount over MRP, Last Purchase Price on GeM and the prices at
which transactions have been conducted on GeM for similar items in the recent past. GeM shall
also incentivize buyers to contribute to the price rigor on the platform by sharing relevant
information.

2.3.4.4 Buyer and Seller Rating

In a trust-based system like GeM, ratings become a key component in the overall system. GeM
shall provide a rating system that evaluates performance on a continuous basis based on
weightages to various parameters. This will reward well-behaving buyers and sellers, incentivize
good buying behavior and cultivate competition in performance amongst sellers.

2.3.4.5 Vendor Assessment

GeM shall provide the facility for availing services (third party) for Vendor Assessment relating to
technical / financial capacity and experience including manufacturing/testing facilities/quality
control arrangement(s) of manufacturing premises. Vendor Assessment to ascertain the quality of
a product or service will also be provided. Sellers shall be incentivized to opt for the assessment
as it will be factored into GeM ratings and the product/service will be marked verified which shall
be a filterable parameter that the buyer can use in their selection process. This will aid buyers in
the decision-making process.

2.3.4.6 Demand Forecasting

GeM shall forecast demand basis the analysis of historical data on the platform and the data
provided by buyers as part of their annual procurement plan. This will help sellers plan better
and in turn ensure availability of required goods/services and lower prices for the buyer.

2.3.5 Quality Assurance

The GeM platform shall do away with some of the traditional quality assurance processes like
centralized seller registration and verification, advance sampling and inspection. It shall instead
have a set of internal checks and controls to drive quality on the GeM platform. These shall
include intrinsic elements across the different modules on the platform such as automated
validation for registration, standardized templates of technical parameters in the category
management system, ratings and vendor assessment as part of decision support and watch
listing and suspension as part the Incident Management policy. Together these shall effect a
robust quality assurance mechanism.

In addition to the above controls, a Quality Assurance Team will maintain the sanctity of the
market on the GeM platform. Random checks hall be conducted periodically for verification of
user accounts and related data, price reasonability, integrity of product and service listings, and
adherence to the terms and conditions of the platform s.

In order to effectively monitor the health of quality of GeM platform, a Quality Framework will be
instituted with a set of quality related KPIs. GeM shall regularly publish a quality report based on
this framework to highlight the progress made on improving quality of the platform.
17
2.3.6 Audit Trail

GeM has been envisioned as a trust based system, and this shall be the basis for many decisions
on the platform. In order to effectively implement this system, GeM shall institute a set of
internal checks and controls. A key aspect amongst these shall be GeM maintaining an audit trail
i.e. a securitized chronological record that provides documentary evidence of the sequence of
activities carried out on the platform during any transaction that takes place on the platform.

The purpose of keeping audit trail in the system is to allow Auditors to evaluate the process
transparently, and review the choice of filters, data, evaluation criteria and confidentiality
techniques that are used on the platform. Aufit trail also aims to ensure that fair practices are
adopted in technical and financial evaluation of bids.

An automated process shall be put into place by GeM to extract logged information generated
during different stages of procurement transactions on the platform. Using few key fields such as
contract number, organization name etc. a bid summary sheet that captures different artifacts,
input/output data and events, can be generated for auditing purposes.

2.3.7 Communication and Support

GeM shall provide a standardized and single channel for communication with stakeholders
through its contact center and domain mail.

2.3.7.1 Communication to Buyers and Sellers

GeM shall send out communication to keep all stakeholders updated with all relevant changes/
notices etc. related to GeM. GeM shall use multiple modes to communicate with its users
depending on the information to be conveyed and its criticality.

GeM shall inform users in the case of new product/service categories being added, end of life
information, change in technical parameters of goods/services, new bids creation or modification
etc. GeM shall also from time to time have promotional and marketing events for which related
communication shall be sent to buyers and sellers. All such information shall also be made
available on the various social media sites of GeM.

2.3.7.2 Contact Center

GeM shall be supported by a contact center well equipped to handle the different queries
users may have. The GeM contact center shall support inbound and outbound customer
communication across different communication channels i.e. telephone, web, chat, email and
social media. Since the contact center shall service stakeholders across different geographical
regions in India, it shall support English, Hindi and certain several regional languages. An
escalation matrix with well-defined SLAs shall be provided to ensure users receive expert help
as needed. GeM may use all communication (ingoing/outgoing) from the center in case of any
query/grievance/any other request.

2.3.7.3 Training and Material

Adequate training support and assistance shall be critical for the success of the GeM platform.
The users of GeM shall not have to face any challenges in using the platform effectively. Thus,
central and regional training as well as the availability of adequate training material on the
platform shall be ensured. GeM may design e-procurement certifications and offer trainings to
certify professionals specialized to procure via the GeM platform.
                                                                                                   18
2.3.8 Dispute Resolution and Incident Management

        GeM shall be a trust-based system and hence it shall be extremely critical to support a structured
        and automated Incident Management process to penalize any deviant behavior. On a platform
        as large as GeM, disputes between buyers and sellers is bound to occur. While GeM provides the
        platform facilitating these transactions, GeM shall not have any authority, legal or otherwise to
        resolve disputes or redress grievances. It shall thus be extremely important to ensure that users
        are cognizant of the fact that GeM is, at the crux of it all, only a platform and cannot and does
        not take over the onus of ensuring that every transaction through it is error free and assured.
        Thus, while GeM shall take administrative action as per the process published, in cases where
        grievance redressal beyond the platform is required, arbitration process shall be applicable and
        GeM shall not be a party to this process.

         •   The role of GeM in Incident Management shall be three fold and limited to:
         •   Making available all the information that may help in the resolution of the dispute.
         •   Providing notice and reasonable opportunity to the party to provide justification
         •   Taking appropriate administrative action, limited to the platform, against the buyer or/and
             seller as the case may be

        GeM shall support a holistic framework for incident management, where deviations on GeM shall
        be categorized into three levels, namely: mild, serious and severe. An appropriate administrative
        action shall be administered on a case-to-case basis. The penalty may range from having the
        deviations recorded against the seller/buyer to blocking or suspending of the defaulting buyer/
        seller account and a blacklisting recommendation to the Board/Ministry of Commerce.

        2.3.9 Data Security

        GeM shall be responsible to ensure the privacy and security of the data on the platform.
        Adequate measures shall be taken to ensure that the GeM platform adheres to the highest
        standards of information security and user privacy.

        2.4 GeM Procurement Guidelines
Public procurement in India is currently
guided by multiple well-founded procurement
guidelines and policies. Since these policies
were drafted in a time before GeM, they were
primarily designed in accordance with the
offline procurement process and not with an
online marketplace in mind. Thus, certain
operational design elements of these policies
may not be entirely relevant on a standardized
technology-driven platform like GeM. With the
advent of GeM, it is critical for the essence of
these policies to be maintained and brought
together in a comprehensive marketplace
procurement process that shall apply to all
procurement on GeM. The GeM procurement
process is built on fundamental principles of


19
public procurement i.e. transparency, value for
money and openness of competition. However,
by virtue of it being a technology-driven
platform, the mechanism and processes by
which it achieves these objectives may change
from the past.

Thus, a set of GeM procurement guidelines for
operating on GeM shall be drafted and shall
apply to all buyers and sellers on the platform
independent of the respective procurement
policies applicable to them outside of the
platform. For procurement made on GeM,
buyers shall abide by the GeM procurement
guidelines and shall not be subject to
compliance issues arising from different
policies that may be applicable to them when
they procure offline/outside GeM.
Some of the indicative directives/processes that
currently exist and shall be re–aligned for the
GeM context include:
 •

 •   Minimum three weeks time to be allowed for
     submission of bids (Rule 161)
 •   Procurement by Limited Tender Enquiry in
     cases of urgent need (Rule 162)
     Evaluation of technical bids to be conducted
 •   by Competent Authority or Technical
     Committee (Rule 163,164)
     Bid Security (EMD) should range between
 •   two percent to five percent of the estimated
     value of goods to be procured (Rule 170)
     Performance Security should be for an
     amount of five to ten percent of the value
 •   of the contract as specified in the bid
     documents (Rule 171)
     Procurement of services by Limited Tender
     Enquiry when the value of the services is
     less than 10 Lakhs (Rule 201)
Therefore, GeM shall institute a set of
procurement guidelines for operating on GeM
that shall apply to all buyers and sellers on
the platform independent of the respective
procurement policies applicable to them outside
of the platform.

Procurement on GeM for all buying entities shall
be exclusively subject to the GeM guidelines,
terms and conditions as published by GeM
on the GeM website, which shall override all

concurrent processes differing from or in conflict
to the process outlined by GeM. GeM, being a
technology-driven platform, shall embed certain
facets of the procurement process in the design
of the GeM platform. GeM shall provide requisite
mechanisms needed to comply with the intent of
the various related central procurement policies
and guidelines defined by the different domain
ministries. For procurement made on GeM, buyers
shall not be subject to compliance issues arising

from different policies that may be applicable
to them when they procure offline/outside GeM
and are not applicable on the GeM platform.
For all circumstances not covered by the GeM
guidelines, terms and conditions, the buyer shall
adhere to the General Financial Rules and/or the
procurement guidelines of the respective entity.
GeM has been established as the national
procurement portal. Thereby, GeM shall seek to
design its procurement process and guidelines in
adherence to the national level directives from
the Government. GeM will continuously look to
new ways of supporting these policies while
adhering to the design principles intrinsic to GeM.
All policies relating to various aspects of GeM
transactions shall be available online and user
feedback shall be inbuilt on the platform.

        Applicability of the guidelines to services

        It is important to recognize that the assessment of quality for services is a continuum. On one
        end, there are a set of standard services where complexity is low and quality may be assessed
        by way of a set of technical specifications. This gives way to slightly complex services, including
        the bundling of goods and services. In such cases, it may be important for the buyer to establish
        relevant work experience as a measure of quality. And on the other end, we have project-based
        buying where quality may be ascertained by multiple aspects such as financial net worth,
        approach and methodology, and current set of completed and ongoing works. Thus, GeM shall
        enable the buyer to make an informed decision basis these different criteria and basis where the
        services lie on the continuum, thereby capturing the essence of Quality and Cost Based Selection.

        Thus, the procurement process for services on GeM, similar to goods, shall be standardized and
        inbuilt into the system and buyers shall not need to follow any concurrent processes that may be
        applicable in the offline procurement process.

        Entities covered by the guidelines

        The GeM procurement guidelines shall be issued pursuant to Rule 149 of the General Financial
        Rules 2017. It has been mandated as per GFR Rule 149 that if a product/service category is           20
available on GeM, all Ministries and Departments shall procure through GeM. Thereby, the
guideline shall apply to all Central Ministries and Departments and the respective Central
Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) under them. The guideline shall also be extended to States
and UTs and the respective State Public Sector Enterprises (SPSEs) and any other Public Sector
organizations by way of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between GeM and the respective
entity. The list of entities with which GeM has entered into a MoU shall be published on the
website and will be continually updated. Thus, the mandate to procure from GeM and the
applicability of this guideline shall also fall onto all buyers falling under the purview of these
entities.

All other buyers like autonomous bodies, apex institutes, charities and other entities where
significant government funding is received shall be recommended to use GeM for the
procurement of goods and services to the extent possible and follow the guidelines stipulated
herein. A detailed description of GeM procurement guidelines has been covered as part of
Appendix B.

2.5 Monetization on the GeM Platform
2.5.1 Introduction

GeM has been setup as a Section 8, not for profit organization. Beyond the initial grant of Rs 200
Cr, GeM is expected to self-sustain its operations. GeM will thus need a means of sustenance for
the organization and its marketplace platform. A monetization model to generate revenue, to
create and cover the following cost elements to sustain operations, shall be required:

     1. Technology and Platform cost - Payout to the Managed Service Provider (MSP)
     2. Personnel Cost – Cost of personnel including Performance Linked Incentives
     3. Marketing Expenses – Expenses incurred in spreading awareness and increasing
     engagement on GeM
     4. General and Admin Expenses – Day-to-day operations expense including contractual
     services
     5. Innovation & Grievance Redressal Fund – Funds for growth and innovation or unexpected
     exigencies

Objectives of the revenue model – The key objectives of the revenue model shall be to:

     1.  Recover costs and self-sustain GeM
     2.  Generate funds to fuel innovation and growth
     3.  Maintain a corpus/buffer for windfall changes

Multiple potential monetization streams exist for GeM and may be applied such as one
time fees like registration fee or listing fee and recurring fees like annual fee, transaction
fee, paid advertisements, value- added services fee etc. GeM shall have the remit to alter the
revenue generation mechanism in terms of the sources that it chooses to monetize and the
quantum of the charge or fee it fixes. In addition, the revenue model shall be leveraged to drive
desired market behavior among buyers and sellers by means of incentives and penalties and
help achieve GeM marketplace objectives.
21
A two-fold revenue model may be instituted for GeM

1. Transaction fee model - Primary model for revenue generation and cost recovery.

2. Behavior-based incentives model – Incentives/disincentives based on specific user behavior
to help achieve GeM marketplace objectives.

2.5.2 Mechanism of Revenue Generation

2.5.2.1 Primary Revenue Generation Model

Key elements of the transaction charge model are as follows:

     Since GeM provides a platform for both buyers and sellers to conduct transactions, both
     buyers and sellers may be charged a small % of their transaction value as transaction fee.
     Sellers may be charged more than buyers in line with the value they derive out of GeM in
     terms of ease of doing business with the Government .

     GeM may also exercise its option to charge transactions only above a certain minimum
     threshold transaction value or it may lay a differential charge on different thresholds of
     transaction values. This shall be designed in accordance with the premise that the user
     willingness to pay will be higher in big-ticket transactions. This shall also ensure higher
     feasibility of implementation and revenue realization for GeM.

     GeM may also explore categorizing product and service categories basis their margin potential
     into buckets such as High, Medium, and Low margin potential. Higher margin categories may
     be charged a relatively higher % of the total transaction as there shall be higher willingness
     to pay for sellers.

     Thus, a transaction fee matrix, clearly laying out the charges applicable on buyers and sellers
     across types of goods and services and across ranges of transaction value, shall be developed
     and deployed on a periodic basis. This matrix shall be designed as per cost recovery
     principles and shall be revised periodically depending on how revenue tracks against the
     costs.

2.5.2.1 Behavior-Based Incentives

Registration Fees and Listing Fees shall serve as secondary revenue generation streams
wherein the primary aim of levying these charges shall be to drive right market behavior and
incentivize/disincentive the participants in line with the marketplace objectives.

A one-time registration fee for sellers shall help maintain the sanctity of the seller base and
drive a sense of discipline in the registration process, prevent sellers from creating multiple,
unnecessary accounts and reduce the number of inactive sellers in the system since only
serious sellers register. Similarly, sellers shall be charged a small listing fee i.e. a fee for every
time the seller wishes to list a new product or service. The fee shall be minimal with the primary
objective being to maintain the sanctity of the marketplace and ensure discipline in the listing
process.

                                                                                                        22
A few illustrative incentive schemes are as follows:

                 Product Upload - To incentivize correct listing process, sellers who make 10 error free
                 listings consecutively can be allowed to make the next 5 listings for free i.e. no listing fees
                 will be levied.

                 Pricing - To incentivize competitive discounting, top sellers that offer the maximum discount
                 on a monthly basis can be given one month of charge free transactions. The rules and
                 incentives shall be changed from time to time depending on desired behaviors to be driven
                 through the marketplace.

    3. GeM Organisation
                  (GeM SPV)



As stated earlier, the Government e Marketplace
Special Purpose Vehicle (GeM SPV) has been set up
to develop, manage and maintain the GeM platform.
To be able to successfully deliver the GeM platform
as described above, it is critical for the GeM
organization to have a clearly defined strategic and
operating model in place.




ii. Establish a lean, dynamic
organization capable of
continuous innovation and
market driven decision making.
iii. Build an easy to use, fully
automated, trust based platform
to ensure transparency and
efficiency in procurement.

iv. Demonstrate commitment to
delivering value by ensuring right
quality at right price.


3.1 Vision, Mission and Values for GeM SPV



In line with the founding principles of GeM, as laid down
by the Cabinet Note dated 7th April 2017, the vision for
GeM articulates the aspiration that GeM shall seek to
achieve. The vision for GeM is thus stated as:

“To effect an evolution in public procurement promoting a
transparent, efficient and inclusive marketplace”

The mission statements lay down the operational facets of
what the GeM SPV shall do in order to realize GeM’s stated
vision. The five mission statements for the GeM SPV are
laid down as:

i. Institute a unified procurement policy to encourage
behavioral change and drive reform.

v. Create a sustainable ecosystem

covering all stakeholders and
driving inclusive development in
India.

The values for GeM SPV are
intrinsic to the identity it aspires
to build. These values are in line
with the beliefs that are core to
the GeM organization and its key
stakeholders. The values system
that GeM shall thus subscribe
to can be explained by a set
of seven fundamental values.
These are: Innovate to Simplify,
Ownership and Accountability,
Be Bold and Think Big,
Responsiveness, Commitment,
Transparency and Integrity and
Social Inclusion.

        23
3.2 Organization Structure
Any typical e-commerce marketplace needs to support 6 key processes:

     • Buyer related processes (e.g. training and onboarding, key account management)
     • Seller related processes (e.g. category management, pricing)
     • Platform related processes (e.g. analytics and reporting, customer care)
     • Strategy related processes (e.g. business planning, partnerships and alliances)
     • Technology related processes (e.g. product development, data warehousing)
     • Internal support processes (e.g. HR, finance, legal support)

In order to execute these processes efficiently, it is important for GeM SPV to have a well-defined
organization structure which is lean, dynamic and market linked. This organization should
have capabilities to build and maintain the platform and fulfil the GeM vision. Therefore, GeM
SPV organization structure has been designed in accordance with best practices from global
benchmarking e-procurement, e-commerce players (such as Amazon, ChileCompra, GeBIZ and
KONEPS). GeM SPV CEO’s organization will have 5 key functions: Marketplace, Technology, Strategy
and Planning, HR and Admin and Finance. In addition, the organization will also house Centers of
Excellence5 to play advisory role on select topics of strategic importance/academic research.

Given government procurement involves multi-crore rupee transactions on a daily basis, it is also
important for GeM to be able to execute its operations with utmost transparency. Therefore, GeM
SPV will also house an Ombudsman. A detailed organization structure has been developed and
has been adopted by the Board as of 5th April 2018.

3.2.1 Model for Talent Acquisition

The Cabinet Note lays down provisions for multiple sources for GeM to build the required
capability and talent:

1. Government employees:
     Government employees hired as full-time employees of GeM SPV.

2. Market employees:
     SPV Market: Market employees hired for critical roles as full-time employees of the GeM SPV
     PMU: Market employees hired on a contractual basis as part of the Project Management Unit
     of the GeM SPV

3. Managed Service Provider:
     GeM shall engage a Managed Service Provider (MSP) to deliver the technical and certain
     operational capabilities of the online marketplace platform.

In order to scientifically identify the right sourcing mechanism for various roles, a two-pronged
approach shall be followed:

1. Strategic Importance or Criticality: Only the most critical roles shall be hired permanently into
the SPV whereas other roles shall be hired on a contract basis in the PMU

2. Specific Skillset Requirement: Given that GeM SPV aspires to build a world-class e-procurement
marketplace, many specific technical and operational skillsets are required. Such specific skillsets
shall be sourced from the market.

                                                                                                         24
5  A detailed document has been prepared that details the process to be followed in setting up the CoEs
Since the GeM SPV aspires to be a dynamic, market-linked organization capable of continuous
 innovation and market-driven decision-making, the GeM SPV shall maintain a healthy balance
 of Government and market sourced employees as per talent the strengths and capabilities
 required.

 3.2.2 Organization Strength

 Role of a Managed Service Provider (MSP) has been envisaged at GeM to deliver the technical &
 operational capabilities of the online marketplace platform. However, in order to cater to the
 other elements of the complete ecosystem (such as Buyers, Sellers, Institutional Partners etc.)
 and address all other organizational aspects (such as Strategy, HR, Admin etc.), a significant
 workforce will need to be recruited by the GeM SPV. In addition, workforce will also be required
 to monitor the deliverables of the MSP.

 The GeM SPV has received the approval to build a 200 – 250 member organization (full-time
 employees + contracted PMU employees) by FY 21. Beyond that, the scale and structure of the
 organization shall depend on the growth of GeM and the evolution of the scope of GeM.

 3.3 Functioning of the GeM SPV

 3.3.3 Centers of Excellence

 In order to build sustainable capabilities and achieve its long-term aspirations, GeM shall create
 Centers of Excellence (CoE) within the organization. These centers will serve as think tanks on
 matters of strategic relevance to GeM in line with its Vision, Mission and Goals. The focus areas
 of these CoEs may be revised from time-to-time based on changing strategic imperatives for the
 organization. For a topic / subject area to be deemed fit for the creation a CoE, it must fulfil the
 following pre-requisites:

 a.   It should be a matter of strategic relevance to GeM in the long term, in line with GeM’s
 vision, mission & goals
 b.   It should help foster innovation in areas outside day-to-day mandate of GeM teams
 c.   It should have sufficient scope to leverage partnerships or collaborations to source relevant
 expertise

 A PoC driven approach may be taken to formulate CoE topics. To continuously innovate and
 enhance the efficiency of the marketplace, GeM may carry out several PoCs within its teams
                                                                                                                                   26
from time to time. Some of these PoCs may prove to have the potential for significant impact
on the GeM ecosystem in the long term, and may require dedicated research and development
effort. Such PoCs may be considered as potential CoE topics / subject areas.

A pipeline of such topics / subjects that may be suitable for creation of a CoE shall be reviewed
periodically for consideration of creation of a new CoE. The periodic review mechanism shall also
provide the opportunity to augment existing CoEs basis the progress made by them.

A CoE shall have an independent budget and well defined KPIs for performance monitoring. A
detailed set of guidelines shall be established by GeM to lay out the following key contours for
setting up and running CoEs:

     • Determining the budget and KPIs for the CoE
     • Mechanism to identify partners for collaboration
     • Rules of engagement with CoE partners
     • Criteria to determine minimum and maximum lifespan for a CoE
3.3.4 Third Party Services and Support Processes

GeM shall additionally leverage third party services in certain areas of catalogue creation, market
sanitization, support services and process audit and in continued services like information
security related services, penetration testing and vulnerability testing.

For the critical supporting functions of HR and Finance, detailed HR Manual and Financial Manual
have been developed and approved by the Board of GeM. The GeM SPV shall adhere to the basic
set of rules and policies that have been laid out as part of these manuals.

3.4 Governance Structure

4.3 Interfacing with Other Key Stakeholders: Guiding Principles of Collaboration
E-Governance has been one of the biggest agenda items in our country. Over the years, a
large number of initiatives have been undertaken by various State Governments and Central
Ministries. GeM is one such key mega-scale initiative that in the long run shall make
significant impact on efficient spending and thus productivity of our country.

GeM shall interact with and have inter-dependencies on multiple stakeholders ranging from
the likes of UIDAI, MCA 21, Banks and other financial institutions to the different monitoring
and vigilance entities such as CVC, CGA. In today’s landscape of rapidly evolving digital
disruptions and the challenges posed by related complexities, collaboration between GeM

29
and these different entities shall thus be critical to ensure the success of GeM. The guiding
principles for collaboration between GeM SPV and its partners shall be threefold:

     i. Shared objectives: Partnerships shall be guided by a shared vision and purpose that builds
     trust and recognizes the value and contribution of each member. GeM SPV and its partners
     shall strive to set up clear objectives and goals that define the success of the partnership.

     ii. Effective information sharing: The exchange of information and best practices is an
     extremely important aspect of collaboration. GeM SPV and its partners shall endeavor to
     institute seamless data sharing and actively explore how the shared information may be
     used effectively.

     iii. Continuous communication: Effective partnerships are built on trust, openness, and
     communication. For effective collaboration, both parties shall take measures to remain
     updated with the others’ plans, objectives, and risks that may have consequential effects on
     the other party.

4.3.1 Collaboration with the Central Ministries

The Procurement Policy Division’s Office Memorandum dated 19.9.2017 notifies the constitution
of Standing Committee of GeM (SCoGeM) for guiding, coordinating and reviewing the use of GeM.
Thus, each Ministry shall constitute a Standing Committee that GeM SPV shall interface with on
different elements such as identification of products and services that GeM should support,
monitoring of timely payments, organizing trainings and monitoring the use of GeM by the
different bodies under the Ministry.

4.3.2 Collaboration with State Governments and Union Territories

The State Governments and Union Territories account for a significant portion of the public
procurement in India. It shall be important for GeM to onboard all the state governments, UTs
and their affiliated bodies. In this respect, GeM SPV shall sign Memorandums of Understanding
(MoUs) to enable the State Governments and UTs to make use of GeM for procurement of goods
and services. Additionally, as stated in 4.3.1, each State shall constitute a Standing Committee
that GeM SPV shall interface with on the different elements of GeM.

4.3.3 Collaboration with Public Sector Units (PSUs)

Public Sector Units (PSUs) account for a significant portion of the public procurement in India
and hence it is of paramount importance for GeM to onboard all PSUs in the country. In this
respect, GeM SPV shall actively seek to collaborate and work together with major PSUs to
understand their requirements and make their transition to GeM seamless.

4.3.4 Roles and Responsibilities of Other Stakeholders

The other stakeholders that shall interact with GeM can be categorized into three types:
Monitoring and Vigilance, Operations, Payments.

                                                                                                    30
4.3.4.1 Monitoring and Vigilance             4.3.4.2 Operations

The two key entities for monitoring and
vigilance are Central Vigilance Commission
(CVC) and Comptroller and Auditor General
(CAG). The primary objectives behind
GeM’s inception are highly aligned with the
objectives of these entities. Transparency
and openness are at the heart of GeM and
thereby there exists great potential for
collaboration between GeM SPV and these
parties.

 •   GeM SPV shall ensure that the platform
     has adequate internal checks and a
     robust system of audit trail thereby
     facilitating auditors to assess and
     evaluate the processes, evaluation
     criteria and confidentiality techniques
     followed by different buyers.

 •   GeM SPV will be privy to a large amount
     of buyer data, which will have multiple
     applications in monitoring and vigilance,
     helping the stated parties in identifying
     irregularities effectively
 •
     GeM SPV shall also commit to extend
     complete support to the extent possible
     in case of any conflict or inquiry related
     to any transaction on the platform

At the same time, the stated parties shall be
required to work with GeM SPV to realign the
rules for procurement on GeM. Additionally,
the stated entities shall ensure that GeM SPV
is notified and consulted before the creation
of any new rules or process guidelines, which
may impact the GeM platform or any related
processes of buying / selling on the GeM
platform.



31
An integral part of GeM’s value proposition
lies in its automated trust based processes. To
enable this, GeM SPV has been partnering with
various entities, both Government and private,
to allow effective data sharing and validation.
The resulting environment shall be a complex
mix of applications and architectures that shall
result in the necessity for the various entities to
collaborate with each other to ensure seamless
operations. Such key entities include Unique
Identification Authority of India (Aadhaar),
Goods and Service Tax Network (GSTN), Income
Tax Department (PAN), Department of Industrial
Policy & Promotion (DIPP), Ministry of Micro
Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME), MCA21,
Controller of Certifying Authorities (CCA) -
e-Sign, DigiLocker etc.

Since GeM SPV shall integrate procedures on its
system with these entities, it is necessary for
these entities to remain cognizant of the fact
that any changes or risks that they encounter
may affect GeM. Thus, GeM SPV shall establish
effective means for secure data sharing and
continuous communication with these entities.

4.3.4.3 Payments

As stated previously, GeM aspires to move
to 100% online payments to ensure a truly
cashless procurement process. GeM SPV
shall require the support of different banks
to be able to achieve this aspiration. In this
regard, GeM SPV shall actively seek to sign
Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with
banks to collaborate and work together.
GeM shall work together with the banks to make
available integrated e-payment systems for
collection and transfer of payments/e-Earnest
Money Deposit (EMD)/e-Performance Bank
Guarantee (PBG), fees and charges and any
other transactions that may be needed.

5.2 Appendix B - GeM Procurement Guidelines

5.2.1 Preface: Role of Government e Marketplace (GeM) in Public Procurement

GeM aspires to effect an evolution in public procurement promoting a transparent, efficient
and inclusive marketplace. GeM uses modern technology and enablers and brings together
all government buyers on a unified online platform for the procurement of commonly used
goods and services. GeM reduces manual process inefficiencies in procurement and provides a
paperless and cashless e-marketplace with a streamlined, consistent process for all users.

The nature of the platform is characterized by three core elements

  •  Openness: GeM shall be an open marketplace wherein it promotes access to information and
     transparency. Relevant information on sellers, products, and services shall be easy to find and
     readily available for both buyers and sellers. GeM shall provide data-based insights to help
     users in decision-making and ascertaining price reasonability.

  •  Fairness: One of GeM’s key objectives is to allow sellers, big and small, to gain direct access
     to Government buyers. In doing so, GeM will ensure that all sellers are treated fairly. GeM
     will not offer preferential or promotional treatment to one seller over the other and shall
     ensure that all sellers are provided with a level playing field. This will ensure the health and
     competitiveness of the marketplace.

  •  Inclusive: GeM promotes inclusion, which means that all Government buyers and sellers are
     accepted on the platform. GeM aspires to create a robust seller base and all sellers interested
     in conducting business with the Government shall be welcomed on the platform. For buyers
     and sellers that do not have the know-how of using GeM, GeM shall provide additional
     assistance in the form of focused training, onboarding sessions and continued feedback and
     support.

In the evolving procurement process in the country, it is useful to reiterate GeM’s role. GeM shall
not be a managed marketplace but shall focus solely on being a platform for Government buyers
to meet sellers and conduct business. It shall neither own the goods and services sold through
the platform nor own the supply and logistics of goods and services transacted on it. GeM shall
be a trust-based portal where the buyer holds the responsibility to ensure value for money in any
purchase made and the seller holds the responsibility to ensure the accuracy and integrity of all
information shared.

5.2.2 Applicability

These guidelines are issued in pursuant to Rule 149 of the General Financial Rules 2017. It has
been mandated as per GFR Rule 149 that if a product/service category is available on GeM, all
Ministries and Departments shall procure through GeM. Thereby, these guidelines shall apply
to all Central Ministries and Departments and the respective Central Public Sector Enterprises
(CPSEs) under them. These guidelines shall also be extended to States and the respective State
Public Sector Enterprises (SPSEs) by way of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between
GeM and the respective entity. The list of entities with which GeM has entered into a MoU shall
be published on the website and will be continually updated. Thus, the mandate to procure from
GeM and the applicability of these guidelines shall also fall onto all buyers falling under the
purview of these entities.

All other buyers like autonomous bodies, apex institutes, charities and other entities where

33
significant government funding is received are recommended to use GeM for the procurement of
goods and services to the extent possible and follow the guidelines stipulated herein.

5.2.3 Need for Marketplace Guidelines

Public procurement in India is currently guided by multiple well-founded procurement
guidelines and policies. Since these policies were drafted in a time before GeM, they were
primarily designed in accordance with the offline procurement process and not with an online
marketplace in mind. Thus, certain operational design elements of these policies may not
be entirely relevant on a standardized technology-driven platform like GeM. With the advent
of GeM, it is critical for the essence of these policies to be maintained and brought together
in a comprehensive marketplace procurement process and guidelines that shall apply to all
procurement on GeM. The GeM procurement process is built on the fundamental principles
of public procurement: that of transparency, value for money and openness of competition.
However, by virtue of it being a technology-driven platform, the mechanism and processes by
which it achieves these objectives may change from the past.

Thus, a set of GeM procurement guidelines for operating on GeM shall apply to all buyers and
sellers on the platform independent of the respective procurement policies applicable to
them outside of the platform. For procurement made on GeM, buyers shall abide by the GeM
procurement guidelines and shall not be subject to compliance issues arising from different
policies that may be applicable to them when they procure offline/outside GeM.

Some of the indicative directives/processes that currently exist but are not relevant or
appropriate while transacting on the marketplace (GeM) include:
     • Mandate for all Ministries and Departments to publish all tender enquiries and details of
     bid awards on CPPP (Rule 159, Rule 201).
     • Minimum three weeks time to be allowed for submission of bids (Rule 161).
     • Procurement by Limited Tender Enquiry in cases of urgent need (Rule 162).
     • Evaluation of technical bids to be conducted by Competent Authority or Technical
     Committee (Rule 163,164).
     • Performance Security should be for an amount of five to ten percent of the value of the
     contract as specified in the bid documents (Rule 171).
     • Procurement of services by Limited Tender Enquiry when the value of the services is less
     than 10 Lakhs (Rule 201).

5.2.4 GeM Procurement Guidelines

GeM has been established as the national procurement portal. Thereby, GeM shall seek to
design it’s procurement process and guidelines in adherence to the national level directives
from the Government. GeM will continuously look to new ways of supporting these policies
while adhering to the design principles intrinsic to GeM. All policies relating to various aspects
of GeM transactions are available on line and user feedback is inbuilt on the platform.

Some of the new processes and mechanisms by which GeM shall support the objectives of the
central directives have been detailed below:

i. Information visibility: Providing buyers with adequate information ensuring visibility for
MSE/local sellers and startups. Further, GeM will enable sellers to indicate the percentage of
domestic content in their goods and services, promoting the Make in India order.
ii. CPPP Integration: Ensuring real time sharing of information relating to all procurement
notices and results.
iii. Decision Support: Ratings on GeM provide complete information about buyers, sellers, and
                                                                                                    34
products (including price history) online based on GeM transaction history.
iv. Monitoring and reporting: GeM shall provide buyers with dashboards and reports to monitor
the trend of their procurement that may help them with adherence to the different directives.
v. Data based insights: The analysis of the transactional data on GeM may enable the
policymakers from MSME and DIPP to recognize key challenges and review and revise
procurement policies accordingly.

Procurement on GeM for all buying entities will be exclusively subject to the GeM guidelines, terms
and conditions as published by GeM on the GeM website, which shall override all concurrent
processes differing from or in conflict to the process outlined by GeM. GeM, being a technology-
driven platform, has embedded certain facets of the procurement process in the design of the GeM
platform. GeM shall provide requisite mechanisms needed to comply with the intent of the various
related procurement policies and guidelines defined by the different domain ministries. However,
it will be incumbent as buyers to ensure compliance with GeM’s guidelines, terms and conditions.
For all circumstances not covered by the GeM guidelines, terms and conditions, the buyer should
adhere to the General Financial Rules and/or the procurement guidelines of the respective entity.

These key facets have been detailed below. Detailed SOPs for the processes (as amended from
time to time) shall be published on the GeM website.
5.2.4.1 Qualifications and credentials of Sellers/Service Providers

By integrating with different Government databases and third-party entities, GeM shall provide
the buyer with the credentials of the seller such as the financial credentials, preferential seller
credentials such as registered MSE or startup and product or service assessment (Vendor
Assessment). GeM shall also provide a seller rating system that evaluates a seller’s performance on
a continuous basis based on weightages to various parameters that capture quality, reliability and
actual performance. Thus, GeM provides a decision support system for qualifying seller credentials
by way of the different filters on the platform. GeM shall enable the buyers to customize the
credentials needs as per their specific requirement.

5.2.4.2 Standardization of Technical Specifications/Parameters

The technical specifications constitute a critical aspect of public procurement. One of the key
facets of GeM is the standardization of these specifications/parameters. GeM shall provide
standardized templates of technical parameters (TP), for both products and services, designed to
maximize objectivity.

GeM shall ensure that these parameters are demand driven, market-aligned, consultative and
dynamic. Demand-driven means that these parameters will be designed keeping in mind the
buyers’ requirements. Market aligned means that the parameters will be guided by market
knowledge and market trends.

Consultative means that GeM shall consult its buyers, sellers and the respective domain experts as
needed to ensure that the TP is designed comprehensively. Dynamic means that GeM shall update
and revise the TP as per the changing needs of the buyer and the market.

This standardization of parameters is the principal virtue of GeM that differentiates it from the
prevalent offline processes and systems. This lends itself to GeM being a fair, open and brand
agnostic platform. In addition, while procuring on GeM, buyers shall not need to invest the time
35
or effort required in identifying the right list of parameters that comprehensively constitute the
product or service.

The standardized parameters also result in standardization of the evaluation mechanism.
Thus, obviates the need to set up a Technical Evaluation Committee or Consultancy Evaluation
Committee while procuring on GeM.

In a scenario where the buyer finds the Technical Parameters defined on GeM for any product
or service as not sufficiently comprehensive and requires parameters to be either added or
modified, the buyer should inform GeM SPV of its requirements. SoP for such upgrades and
updates of TP of GeM catalog will be dynamic and evolving, without compromising on the need to
keep GeM catalog generic at all times.

5.2.4.3 Price Reasonability

GeM shall provide the buyer with multiple tools to help the buyer ascertain price reasonability
such as comparison of prices across other e-commerce sites (wherever available), discount over
MRP, Last Purchase Price on GeM and the prices at which transactions have been conducted
on GeM for similar items in the recent past. Buyers should also use the Last Purchase Price as
recorded by the buying entity in ascertaining price reasonability. The responsibility to ascertain
the reasonability of price for any buying on GeM rests solely with the buyer. Buyer will be
incentivized to contribute to the price rigor on the platform by sharing relevant information.

5.2.4.4 Modes of Procurement on GeM

As mentioned earlier, for all products and services available on GeM, buyers must procure
through GeM. Since GeM aims to be a one-stop shop for buyers, buyers shall not be required to
publish or advertise the opportunity on any platform outside of GeM when procuring from GeM.

GeM supports three primary buying modes and the appropriate use of the buying mode shall
be indicated by the platform as per the total value of the procurement. The three buying modes
supported are Direct Purchase, Direct Purchase with L1 and e-bid/RA. Thus, all other procurement
modes such as Purchase without Quotations or Purchase by Purchase Committee or Purchase
through Limited Tender Enquiry shall not be applicable for the products and services available on
GeM. Since inclusivity is one of the core elements of GeM, GeM shall not support purchase within
a limited seller group. Maximizing the number of competing sellers will only result in better
prices for the buyer.

As a marketplace, since all sellers receive real-time notifications when relevant bids are
published, minimum period time of 10 days has been deemed sufficient. Similarly, for
performance guarantee on GeM, the recommended value is 2% of the contract value. The lower
amount of performance guarantee needed on GeM stems from the fact that GeM is a trust-based
system with multiple inbuilt systems enabling seller qualification as described previously. Also,
lowering the performance guarantee allows GeM to maximize inclusivity and the number of
sellers participating and reduce the overall cost of the transaction.

5.2.4.5 Procurement of Services

As mentioned earlier, the standardization of parameters is a crucial facet of GeM and is a key
mechanism by which GeM enables the buyer to ascertain the quality for both products and
services.
                                                                                                    36
However, it is important to recognize that the assessment of quality for services is a continuum. On
one end, there are a set of standard services where complexity is low and quality may be assessed
by way of a set of technical specifications. This gives way to slightly complex services, including the
bundling of products and services. In such cases, it may be important for the buyer to establish
relevant work experience as a measure of quality. And on the other end, we have project-based
buying where quality may be ascertained by multiple aspects such as financial net worth, approach
and methodology, and current set of ongoing works. Thus, GeM enables the buyer to make an
informed decision basis these different criteria and basis where the services lie on the continuum,
thereby capturing the essence of Quality and Cost Based Selection.

Thus, the procurement process for services, similar to products, will be inbuilt into the system and
buyers shall not need to follow any concurrent processes that may be applicable in the offline
procurement process.

5.2.4.6 Order Fulfillment and Payment

GeM lays down a standardized process with definite timelines for both order fulfillment and
payment. Buyers must ensure that they follow the online process and update the required
information/issue certificates as applicable and in a timely manner. The process laid out by GeM
shall replace any parallel processes followed currently.

All key documents for order fulfillment and payment such as purchase/sanction order, invoice and
bill shall be generated by the platform based on user input and selections. GeM shall stipulate the
timelines for the different stages of the process such as delivery of the goods/services, generation
of Provisional Receipt Certificate (PRC), generation of Consignee Receipt and Acceptance Certificate
(CRAC), and transfer of payment. GeM reserves the right to take appropriate action in case of non-
adherence.

5.2.4.7 Contract Management

The contract shall be auto-generated on the GeM platform basis the specified technical
parameters, the details chosen by the buyer such as delivery period and delivery terms and the
General Terms and Conditions (GTC) of the platform, the product/service specific Special Terms and
Conditions (STC) and the bid/RA specific Additional Terms and Conditions (ATC) if applicable. There
is no need for the buyer to include any additional terms and conditions in the contract.

5.2.4.8 GeM Service levels

As an online system for procurement, GeM service levels aim at maximum efficiency in its
operations from placing a demand to closing with payments on time for contracts fulfilled. Each of
the steps across transactions have specified time for performance by both sellers and buyers. GeM
SPV shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that both buyers and sellers adhere to these
terms and conditions. These measures shall include Ratings (parameters), issuing notices, watch
list and defaulters being disabled.

5.2.5 Other Actionables for Buyers

5.2.5.1 Uploading of Annual Procurement Plan

Rule 149 (vi) of the GFR 2017 states “The Ministries/Departments shall work out their procurement
requirements of Goods and Services on either OPEX model or CAPEX model as per their
requirement/suitability at the time of preparation of Budget Estimates (BE) and shall project
37
their Annual Procurement Plan of goods and services on GeM portal within 30 days of Budget
approval.”

     i. Thus, in line with the GFR mandate, all buyers must provide a projection of their annual
     demands in the format prescribed by GeM indicating required goods/services along with
     the specification, quality, quantity, consignee location and time of requirement etc. at the
     beginning of the financial year. The buyer will have the flexibility to continuously update the
     plan.

     ii. The information will be used by GeM for predictive assessment and to allow effective
     demand forecasting and planning. This will help sellers plan better and in turn ensure
     availability of required products/services and lower prices for the buyer. Removal of Difficulty
