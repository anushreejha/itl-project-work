## Tools Overview

### LlamaParse
- **Description**: An advanced parsing model designed to extract structured and unstructured data from PDFs efficiently.
- **Features**:
  - Supports multiple output formats (e.g., text, markdown).
  - Multithreading for faster processing.
  - Provides verbose output for detailed insights.
- **Use Case**: Best suited for parsing complex, unstructured documents that require advanced text interpretation.

### PDFMiner
- **Description**: A Python library specifically designed for extracting text from PDF files.
- **Features**:
  - Lightweight and efficient.
  - Ideal for simpler, text-centric PDF files.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for quick extraction of plain text from straightforward PDFs.

## Results

### Processing Times

#### LlamaParse Results
| PDF File | Processing Time (s) |
|----------|----------------------|
| pdf3.pdf | 6.08                |
| pdf2.pdf | 11.69               |
| pdf1.pdf | 141.24              |

#### PDFMiner Results
| PDF File | Processing Time (s) |
|----------|----------------------|
| pdf3.pdf | 0.51                |
| pdf2.pdf | 0.49                |
| pdf1.pdf | 1.84                |

### Observations
- **Performance**:
  - PDFMiner is significantly faster, especially with low-complexity files.
  - LlamaParse takes longer but is designed for more complex parsing tasks.
- **Scalability**:
  - LlamaParse's multithreading and advanced features make it suitable for large-scale, complex projects.
  - PDFMiner is optimal for smaller, simpler tasks where speed is critical.
